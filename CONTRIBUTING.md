# Contributing to this Awesome List

Thanks for wanting to contribute. This document explains what is expected when adding, improving, or reporting items.

## Guiding principles
- Curated, high-quality, and relevant resources only.
- Prefer free, open, well-documented, and actively maintained projects/resources.
- No spam, self-promotion without clear value, or low-effort entries.
- Keep items unique â€” don't duplicate links already listed.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make changes in your branch.
3. Open a pull request (PR) against the default branch.
4. Address review comments and ensure checks pass.

## Adding a resource
- Add items to the most appropriate section.
- Keep alphabetical order within the section.
- Use the format:
  - [Name](https://example.com) â€” One-sentence description. Optional tags (e.g., cli, lib, tutorial).
- Keep descriptions short and factual; avoid superlatives like "best" or "must-have."

Example:
- [Example Project](https://example.org) â€” Lightweight tool for X, supports Y and Z.

## Proposing a new category
- Open an issue explaining the rationale and include at least 3 example links to populate the category.
- If consensus is reached, add the new section and keep it consistent with the rest of the list.

## Pull request checklist
- [ ] The resource meets the repository criteria.
- [ ] Added in the correct section and alphabetized.
- [ ] Description is concise and accurate.
- [ ] No broken links; run a link check locally if available.

## Reporting issues
- For broken links, typos, or outdated info: open an issue or send a PR with the fix.
- When opening an issue include:
  - A clear title.
  - The section or link affected.
  - Reproduction steps or the expected vs actual result.

## Review process & maintenance
- Maintainers will review PRs and issues. They may request changes or close PRs that do not meet guidelines.
- If a PR or issue is inactive, it may be closed. Reopen or re-submit with fixes.

## Code of conduct
Follow the repository's Code of Conduct. If none exists, please act respectfully and professionally. Abusive or harassing behavior will not be tolerated.

## License & contribution rights
By contributing, you agree that your contribution will be licensed under the repository's license. This document is, in effect, thereby considered a Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA).

## Automation & checks
If the repo has automated checks (link checkers, linters, CI), make sure your changes pass them. Fix warnings/errors reported by CI before requesting a final review.

Thank you for helping keep this list useful and well-maintained! ðŸ’™
